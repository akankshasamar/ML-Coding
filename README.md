The very first Ml model on which i have studied is Fashion-MNIST in which there is basic(image) classification i have worked with:

Following are the steps to do for Ml modelling:
#load dataset
#explore dataset
#preprocess data
#build the model
#compile model
#train model
#evaluate accuracy
#overfitting
